/**
 * Ancestor Chain Builder
 *
 * This module deals with walking the archival hierarchy upwards. A
 * description like `co-ahr-0001-item-042` sits at the bottom of a chain —
 * item inside a file inside a series inside a fonds. To render a
 * breadcrumb the frontend needs the full chain, oldest to youngest. The
 * loader used to do this walk on every page render (Eleventy filter);
 * this module does it once at build time and bakes the chain onto each
 * description record so Hugo templates stay dumb iterators.
 *
 * `buildAncestorChain` takes the current description plus a `byRefCode`
 * Map built from the full descriptions array and walks `parent_reference_
 * code` pointers upwards. The returned array is oldest-ancestor-first —
 * ready to drop into a breadcrumb UI.
 *
 * A cycle in the parent pointers is a backend data bug, not a frontend
 * tolerance concern. The walker therefore hard-caps at 20 hops and
 * throws — the build should break loudly so the cycle gets fixed
 * upstream. 20 is a comfortable ceiling;
 * real archival hierarchies rarely exceed 6 levels.
 *
 * @version v1.0.0
